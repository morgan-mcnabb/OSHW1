PROJECT GOALS: THE BRIDGE KEEPER

This project is meant to model the scene from "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" where the Knights of the Round Table encounter
the Gorge of Eternal Peril guarded by the "Keeper".

The Keeper poses three questions to any Knight that wishes to cross the Bridge of Death:
  1. "What is your name?"
  2. "What is your quest?"
  3. "What is your favorite color?"
  
If a Knight correctly answers each of the three questions, the Keeper allows that Knight to cross the Bridge of Death. 
If that Knight incorrectly answers any question asked by the Keeper, the Keeper throws that Knight into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.
